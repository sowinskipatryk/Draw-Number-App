# Draw-Number-App

This simple app helps you decide which option to pick when you cannot decide yourself.
First you need to check how many options are there to choose from using the seek bar e.g. if you want to choose what color of dress you shall wear today - black, blue or red - you will set the seek bar to 3 options.
Then you need to click on the Draw button and it will randomly generate the output in range of 1 to number specified with seek bar.
For example if you set the seek bar to 3, the range for the draw will be [1,2,3] and the output number randomly generated by the app is 2 - the result shows on the screen.
